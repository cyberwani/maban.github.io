<p>I will have to be brief because I feel riddled with guilt whenever I spend time doing anything other than revision.</p>

<p>So this is the second week of exams.  Last week I did my Module 4 <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ICT</span></span> exam, which was&#8230; well&#8230; the questions were quite reasonable, apart from the one asking me to describe the &#8216;behaviour&#8217; of a computer system which threw me a bit.  I was feeling great at the beginning of the exam and pacing myself well (even writing legibly!)  Last year I rushed and finished in half the time and spent the remaining hour fretting because I thought I hadn&#8217;t been given all of the questions.</p>

<p>Half-way through the question paper, my hand felt as though it was going to drop off (the result of not having used a pen in weeks, and not having written more than a paragraph by hand since the AS exams last year).  So my answers were not as well thought out, and I think I fell into my bad habit of making up words when I can&#8217;t find one that works well in the sentence.</p>

<p>I finished with just 5 minutes to spare and checked through the paper to see if I&#8217;d labeled all the question numbers correctly.  I then realised I&#8217;d missed out a question and spent the remaining 30 seconds scribbling an answer between the lines.  Oh dear.</p>

<p>Up next is my Media exam on Thursday which involves writing two essays in response to questions based on Audience, Representation or Genre.  Then on Friday I have a 4 hour exam paper in the morning for Design &amp; Technology.  I don&#8217;t know what this will contain because it&#8217;s a completely new syllabus ..which is a bit daunting..  Then Friday afternoon I&#8217;ll be sitting my Module 5 <span class="caps"><span class="caps">ICT</span></span> exam.  Fun fun fun.  So that&#8217;s 6 hours of exams in one day.  The morning one will probably run over lunch too, so I&#8217;ll have no time to eat :(</p>

<p>But after Friday, it will be all over. Then I will have the rest of the Summer to worry about things like getting a job so I can buy shoes that don&#8217;t have holes in them </p>
