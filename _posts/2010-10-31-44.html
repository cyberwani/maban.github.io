title: Talking on the state of web education
---

<p>A couple of weeks ago I gave a talk at <a href="http://www.londonwebstandards.org/">London Web Standards</a> on Web Education. It&#8217;s a topic that&#8217;s very close to my heart and I&#8217;m trying to spread the word about how poor the teaching of web design is in schools.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the video to the talk, and I&#8217;ll be publishing a write-up of it when I come back from speaking at <a href="http://www.drumbeat.org/drumbeat_festival_2010">Mozilla Drumbeat Festival</a> next week.</p>
