title: On confidence
---

<p>I got an email last night referring to a bit in the latest Unfinished Business where I mention public speaking. It was a stupid comment I made to Andy about how I used to do whatever I could when I was younger to duck out of class presentations. To be honest, I thought I&#8217;d edited it out. It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;m proud of and I didn&#8217;t want to encourage other young people to do the same. Presenting ideas to your peers is an important thing to do and get used to doing, but I&#8217;d had a shitty time at school and spent a good part of it trying to be invisible.</p>

<p>The email asked how I went from that to having the confidence to speak at conferences.</p>

<p>I find speaking incredibly difficult. Some of my talks don&#8217;t go down well. I&#8217;ve read comments from people after a conference saying mine was the worst talk they&#8217;d ever seen.</p>

<p>Speaking is nice when it goes well, but I see it as a big risk. When I&#8217;ve worked so hard on a talk that I&#8217;ve been so nervous that I couldn&#8217;t deliver it well enough, it makes me question whether I&#8217;m good at my job.</p>

<p>I limit the number of conferences I do a year to 2 or 3 because in the months leading up to them, I get really stressed. More than that and it starts to affect my work. In the two weeks leading up to Update and Full Frontal, I could barely eat. Most of the time, I can&#8217;t go to speakers dinners because I feel so ill before doing a talk.</p>

<p>In the short term, speaking at conferences loses me money. I put days, sometimes weeks aside to prepare a talk, even if I&#8217;ve done it before. I like to know my talk inside out, be able to anticipate every question that might come up because I don&#8217;t want people to think I&#8217;ve been invited as the token woman. I want people to think I&#8217;ve done a good job. People have paid to be there and I don&#8217;t want to let the organisers down.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t speak for profile, I do it because I have something I want to tell people. Like when I was talking about education, that was something really important to me and I felt best placed to talk about it because I&#8217;d just left school. Or console browsers, I think they&#8217;re important and nobody else seems to be talking about them.</p>

<p>These days, I&#8217;m very picky. I only speak at conferences where I personally know the organiser. I&#8217;ve been burnt before by organisers who I thought were looking out for me.</p>

<p>I only speak if my travel and accommodation are covered and I&#8217;m paid my day rate, because as I mentioned before, speaking, at least as a freelancer, is expensive. Maybe this makes me sound a bit up myself, but most of the time I&#8217;d rather spend that time quietly doing client work. Most people say it gets easier, but I&#8217;ve not found that. But sometimes I do it because, when it goes really well, it&#8217;s worth all that stress.</p>

<p>Basically, I don&#8217;t want people to think that to give a talk at a conference you have to be a confident speaker. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever be, but my hope is that if my content is good enough, people will see through any weakness in the way I present it.</p>
