title: Review of CushyCMS
---

<p>A few days ago, I came upon the CushyCMS website <a href="http://www.cushycms.com/">www.cushycms.com</a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve tried using WordPress, Drupal, Joomla! and Mambo, and I&#8217;m not going to pretend this is better than them all.  It&#8217;s not, it just meets a different need.  Whereas <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CMS</span></span>s such as WordPress are great if you want to make a site with a blog, have the ability to add pages, plugins, and change themes, sometimes sites don&#8217;t need all that functionality.  Maybe on a 5 page site, you just want to be able to let the client change a few words every now and then, so a full-blown <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CMS</span></span> can be a little overwhelming.</p>

<h3>Here&#8217;s how CushyCMS works:</h3>

<p>in your <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML</span></span> file, you define the bits you want to be editable by adding <code>class=&amp;quot;cushycms&amp;quot;</code></p>

<p>so a heading could be tagged as <code>&amp;lt;h1 class=&amp;quot;cushycms&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Heading&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;</code>, and the editable content <code>&amp;lt;div class=&amp;quot;cushycms&amp;quot; title=&amp;quot;Main Content&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;</code></p>

<h3>Trying it out</h3>

<p>I thought I&#8217;d give it a go with a small project I was working on.  It says it is standards compliant, and I had a look at the company that created it to reassure myself.  It&#8217;s built by Stateless Systems based in Australia <a href="http://www.statelesssystems.com/">www.statelesssystems.com</a> and their other projects look quite interesting too: an alternative <span class="caps"><span class="caps">PDF</span></span> viewer, a login sharing system to allow people to bypass web registration, and a coupon sharing site.</p>

<p>I created an account, typed in my <span class="caps"><span class="caps">FTP</span></span> details, and browsed for the pages I&#8217;d given classes.  It seemed a little sluggish, but that may have been a slow connection at my end.  I would have liked to have been able to assign more than one page at a time, as selecting the file, waiting for it to load, and doing the process again seemed a little monotonous.</p>

<h3>Editing Content</h3>

<p>The pages I&#8217;d assigned displayed in a list with a little edit icon.  Clicking on this takes me to a form.  There is a field for each of the classes I&#8217;d assigned, and the interface looks quite similar to if I were sending an email, which is nice for less technically experienced clients.  I guess it could be compared to Contribute which is what I would have considered using instead.</p>

<p>At the moment, I&#8217;m labeled as &#8216;Designer&#8217; in the menu, which I guess is Administrator.  I can assign editors to the site, and they get a stripped down version of what I can see.  As an editor I can&#8217;t add pages, but if I wanted to do that, I would be looking for a more functional <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CMS</span></span>.</p>

<h3>Assigning Editors</h3>

<p>One thing that I wanted to do but couldn&#8217;t was to create more than one Administrator.  The administrator can assign many websites and editors to their account, but there can only be one administrator to each account.  I also can&#8217;t make multiple accounts with the same email address, which I suppose is to encourage people to upgrade to a Pro account (which costs $28 a month &#8211; around Â£15).  This lets you brand the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CMS</span></span> and have unlimited sites and editors.</p>

<h3>The Prognosis</h3>

<p>To sum up, I think CushyCMS is a great solution for small sites that don&#8217;t need content changed that often, as it gives the client more control.  Also, some <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CMS</span></span>s make me feel quite restricted in how I design the site.  At the moment, I feel like I have to design sites around the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CMS</span></span>, but I prefer to design a site, and have the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CMS</span></span> integrate into it.  Maybe being able to do this comes with experience!</p><br />

<p>I&#8217;m tempted to take the plunge to Pro when I have enough of these types of projects to make it worthwhile.  I&#8217;d really appreciate your opinions on whether you think this is a good solution, or if it will turn my code into scrambled egg. </p>
