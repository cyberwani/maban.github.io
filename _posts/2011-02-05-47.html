<p>I&#8217;ve grown up in a society where computer literacy is just as important as knowing how to read and write. I can&#8217;t think of many jobs where some form of IT knowledge isn&#8217;t useful (or essential), and this is a time when the IT sector is crying out for more skilled workers.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be in this industry if it weren&#8217;t for my <abbr title="Information Communication Technology"><span class="caps">ICT</span></abbr> teachers. They were encouraging and inspiring, and the most hard-working people I know. They had everything stacked up against them; budget cuts, staff cuts and a massive workload, but they didn&#8217;t let that show in lessons. I&#8217;m very worried for their futures.</p>

<h2><span class="caps">ICT</span> being axed?</h2>

<p>A few weeks ago I found out that, rather than being improved, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8272080/National-curriculum-review-compulsory-subjects-could-be-axed.html"><span class="caps">ICT</span> may be dropped from the statutory curriculum altogether</a>, and I&#8217;ve been gathering as much information as I can about this. I&#8217;ve <a href="http://community.tes.co.uk/forums/22.aspx">loitered in <span class="caps">ICT</span> teacher forums</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/andyburnhammp/status/33835672871641088">written to the Shadow Education Secretary</a> and read dozens of articles and white papers.</p>

<p>The Education Secretary, Michael Gove, is formally reviewing the National Curriculum. He wants to slim it down to focus on the &#8220;core subjects&#8221;.</p>

<p>Here is the list of subjects that he&#8217;s confirmed will remain a <a href="http://www.teachernet.gov.uk/management/atoz/n/nationalcurriculum/">statutory part of the National Curriculum</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>English</li>
	<li>Maths</li>
	<li>Science</li>
	<li>PE</li>
</ul>

<p>He doesn&#8217;t see <span class="caps">ICT</span> as a core subject so it is not on the list. Neither are the creative subjects such as art, music, design and technology. Provision will still be made to teach Religious Education, but there has been no mention of <span class="caps">ICT</span>.</p>

<h3>Students giving up on <span class="caps">ICT</span></h3>

<p>The Royal Society wrote an article back in August called &#8220;<a href="http://royalsociety.org/Current-ICT-and-Computer-Science-in-schools/">Current <span class="caps">ICT</span> and Computer Science in schools &#8211; damaging to UK&#8217;s future economic prospects?</a>&#8220;. In this, they they reported on the drop in the number of students taking <span class="caps">ICT</span> exams, and blamed the poor curriculum.</p>

<blockquote>Numbers of students studying computing are plummeting across the UK, with a fall of 33% in just three years in <span class="caps">ICT</span> <span class="caps">GCSE</span> students, a fall of 33% in six years in A level <span class="caps">ICT</span> and 57% in eight years in A level Computing students in England and similar declines found elsewhere in the UK</blockquote>
<p class="attr"><a href="http://royalsociety.org/Current-ICT-and-Computer-Science-in-schools/">&#8212; The Royal Society: <cite>Current <span class="caps">ICT</span> and Computer Science in schools &#8211; damaging to UK&#8217;s future economic prospects?</cite></a></p>

<h3>Training budgets cut</h3>

<p>This comes at the same time as <abbr title="Initial Teacher Training"><span class="caps">ITT</span></abbr> budgets for 2011-2012 have been slashed for people training to be <span class="caps">ICT</span> teachers to <a href="http://www.tda.gov.uk/about/latest-announcements/itt-places-bursaries-2011-12.aspx">&pound;0 (from &pound;9000)</a>. The amount of the budget per subject is determined by predicted demand and supply. Is this a sign that <span class="caps">ICT</span> teachers are no longer needed?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of confusion about the government&#8217;s plans and it all feels a bit sinister. This is a comment by a teacher on the <abbr title="Times Educational Suppliment"><span class="caps">TES</span></abbr> forum asking what&#8217;s going on.</p>

<blockquote>Is it my imagination or has the number of <span class="caps">ICT</span> jobs dried up all of a sudden? I counted 6 <span class="caps">ICT</span> jobs in today&#8217;s <span class="caps">TES</span> &#8211; a record low for this time of year? This was combined with a meeting today in which our Head of Department announced that <span class="caps">GCSE</span> <span class="caps">ICT</span> will not after all appear in this year&#8217;s options for year 9, although functional skills as an option is being offer &#8211; executive decision with which he doesn&#8217;t agree. Wow. That came from nowhere. That&#8217;s a lot of teacher-hours just gone splat.</blockquote>

<h2>The importance of <span class="caps">ICT</span></h2>

<p>I just can&#8217;t comprehend why Gove doesn&#8217;t consider <span class="caps">ICT</span> important enough to be a statutory part of the National Curriculum. Hasn&#8217;t he read all the reports by educational advisors?</p>

<p><span class="caps">NAACE</span> considers <span class="caps">ICT</span> a baseline entitlement for all children. Let me say that again. <em>Baseline entitlement</em>.</p>

<blockquote>The National Curriculum has established <span class="caps">ICT</span> as a subject in its own right in schools and has helped to provide a baseline entitlement for all children.</blockquote>
<p class="attr"><a href="http://www.naace.co.uk/get.html?_Action=GetFile&_Key=Data9733&_Id=673&_Wizard=0&_DontCache=1214829058"><cite>Summary of <span class="caps">NAACE</span> submission to the Rose review</cite> &#8212; <span class="caps">PDF</span> 40.7k</a></p>

<p>The Department for Education wrote a National Strategy for <span class="caps">ICT</span> that stressed the importance of teaching <span class="caps">ICT</span>, and recommended that schools provide time for &#8220;discrete <span class="caps">ICT</span> lessons&#8221; (standalone lessons rather that as part of another subject):</p>

<blockquote>To ensure rigour and progression in the development of pupils&#8217; <span class="caps">ICT</span> capability, schools need to provide time for discrete <span class="caps">ICT</span> lessons taught by specialist teachers of <span class="caps">ICT</span>.</blockquote>
<p class="attr"><a href="http://nationalstrategies.standards.dcsf.gov.uk/node/17839"><cite>Learning and Teaching in <span class="caps">ICT</span></cite> &#8212; The National Strategies</a></p>

<p><abbr title="Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills">Ofsted</abbr>, the standards body that regulates schools, also wrote a report on the importance of <span class="caps">ICT</span>, and how teaching it is essential to the economy.</p>

<blockquote>Schools must equip young people with the 21st century skills necessary to ensure their employability</blockquote>
<p class="attr"><a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/content/download/9167/101177/file/The%20importance%20of%20ICT.pdf">Ofsted report on &#8220;The importance of <span class="caps">ICT</span>&#8221; based on a 4 year study of almost 200 secondary and primary schools in England on their performance in <span class="caps">ICT</span></a></p>

<h2>Why drop it?</h2>

<p>This gives me the impression that Gove wants schools to drop <span class="caps">ICT</span> lessons in favour of integrating it into his core subjects. Perhaps this is because he knows that the <a href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/Ofsted-home/Publications-and-research/Browse-all-by/Documents-by-type/Thematic-reports/The-importance-of-ICT-information-and-communication-technology-in-primary-and-secondary-schools-2005-2008">current curriculum <span class="caps">ICT</span> is so poor that students are teaching the teachers</a>, and the <a href="http://royalsociety.org/Current-ICT-and-Computer-Science-in-schools/">lessons are so boring that the number of students taking <span class="caps">GCSE</span> <span class="caps">ICT</span> has dropped year-on-year</a>. Maybe it&#8217;s because teaching it as a standalone subject is expensive, so axing it would bring in some short-term cash, but to the immeasurable cost of the IT skills of thousands of students.</p>

<p>If Gove did decide to integrate <span class="caps">ICT</span> into his core subjects, this would result in an inferior level of education for students. Here are a few of my problems with this method (from my own experience) as opposed to teaching it a standalone subject:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Lessons are too often repeated. I had several teachers who repeatedly got us to make Powerpoint presentations on a particular topic because this software was all they were confident in using.</li>
	<li>Teachers will not be as trained in using and teaching <span class="caps">ICT</span> as someone who teaches it full-time. Therefore lessons will not be as in-depth</li>
	<li>Some teachers will try to shoehorn <span class="caps">ICT</span> into their lessons where it doesn&#8217;t really fit, just to tick the &#8220;used a computer&#8221; box.</li>
	<li>Resources are limited. Computer rooms have to be booked days in advance. If all lessons have to use <span class="caps">ICT</span>, the school has to buy more computer suites and since the &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ukschools/archive/2010/07/07/harnessing-technology-grant-kicking-a-grant-while-it-s-down.aspx">Harnessing Technology Grant has been halved</a>&#8220;, schools simply do not have this money.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The industry and the economy will pay the price</h2>

<p>This comes at a time when growth in the IT industry is already being stifled. The computer games industry <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10374867">predicts a 10% growth over the next 4 years, but has been denied future tax-breaks</a>, leading to many games publishers <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10382765">threatening to leave the UK</a> and relocate to countries that are nurturing their sector.</p>

<blockquote>The tax break proposed by the previous Labour government could have created 3,000 new jobs and &pound;457m to spend on development, according to <span class="caps">KPMG</span> Scotland. The industry is also estimated to contribute &pound;1bn to the UK&#8217;s <span class="caps">GDP</span> each year.</blockquote>
<p class="attr"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10382765"><span class="caps">BBC</span> News <cite>Budget news prompts game industry threat to leave UK</cite></a></p>

<p>Europe is also facing <a href="http://www.xplora.org/ww/en/pub/insight/misc/specialreports/eun_white_paper_women_it.htm">massive shortages of skilled workers in the tech sector</a>, so it makes sense to train students who can fill these deficits and contribute to the economy.</p>

<h2>How you can help</h2>
