title: Biscuits!!!

<p>Today I’m going to talk about something vitally important and close to my heart… biscuits! The following is a constructive analysis of my 5 favourite biscuits, weighing out their pros and cons.</p>

<p>Isn’t it obvious that I’m putting off doing something more important?</p>

<h2>Number 5 – Custard Creams</h2>

<p>These are plain biscuits with a layer of cream in the middle which isn’t too sickly sweet. I like the pretty pattern they have on the outside too. They are perfect when dunked in tea because they don’t immediately go soggy.</p>

<h2>Number 4 – Bourbons</h2>

<p>Similar construction to custard creams, but with chocolate biscuit and filling. These are also lovely dunked in tea. They do go a bit mank if left open though!</p>

<h2>Number 3 – Oreos</h2>

<p>I used to find it almost impossible to get these anywhere in the UK, now they seem to sell them all over the place. These are dark chocolate biscuits with a custard-cream-like filling. In the US, they make loads of different flavoured ones, and even ones with double the filling! They’re quite expensive though, so nice as a treat!</p>

<h2>Number 2 – The Pink Wafer Biscuit</h2>

<p>Incredibly addictive. The biscuit consists of layers of pink wafer, sandwiched between layers of vanilla. The problem is they are very very moreish and I often find myself feeling ill after demolishing an entire packet because they’re so sweet.. Dipping them in tea can result in a lot of soggy pink stuff at the bottom of the mug.</p>

<h2>Number 1 – Chocolate Caramel Digestives</h2>

<p>These are immense! They take the chocolate digestive template, but have an inner layer of caramel, which really complements the chocolate and the biscuit components.</p>

<p>…that was way too many big words!</p>

<p>Every friend I have introduced these to has become completely obsessed with them. Sometimes we’ll have conversations like this:</p>

<p>“do you want to come round for a cup of tea?”</p>

<p>“..mmm… naahh, I’ve got some really important..”</p>

<p>“I’ve got caramel digestives…”</p>

<p>“OOHH! OK!”</p>

<p>Because of the properties of the caramel, the biscuit does not tend to crumble as much as others, but the chocolate is very melty and sticky (especially when dunked). Mmmmmmmmm……</p>
