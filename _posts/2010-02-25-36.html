title: One way to make your invoices less scary
---

<p>If you&#8217;re like me, you always feel a twinge of guilt when sending an invoice to a client.  It&#8217;s not that you feel you&#8217;ve done a bad job, you just find it hard to ask for money, especially when it&#8217;s in exchange for doing something you enjoy.</p>

<p>Wording the email/letter is difficult.  It has to go something along the lines of &#8220;Hi, I&#8217;ve attached an invoice for x which you have to pay in 14 days. Please.&#8221;</p>

<p>Recently, I&#8217;ve started adding a few Google Analytics stats to client emails when I&#8217;m sending them an invoice for content changes they&#8217;ve asked me to make on a site.  I feel that I&#8217;m giving the client useful information that makes my request for money seem a little less routine, and hope that it shows I care as much about the success of their website as they do.</p>

<p>For example, for one client who organises children&#8217;s parties, I let her know that &#8220;netmums&#8221; was her top referring site which had an average time on site 3 times greater than the overall site average. I also told her that the linger time for returning visitors was 2 times the average for the site overall, indicating that people coming back did so because they were making a decision, or they were going through the site with someone else.</p>

<p>I then got this reply:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Thanks so much for all that info its really useful! I was about to pull my netmums subscription but now I am so not going to!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This wouldn&#8217;t be possible with every client invoice, especially for sites that have just gone live and don&#8217;t have any useful stats, but for clients you want to maintain a long term relationship with, this might make your request for money a little less painful.</p>

<p>Is there something you can recommend to make invoices more friendly? </p>
