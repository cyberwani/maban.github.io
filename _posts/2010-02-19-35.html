title: The Ultimate Chocolate Cake
---

<p>I&#8217;ve had a few people ask me for the recipe of the chocolate cake I made for the 200th Boagworld. I wasn&#8217;t going to post this on my blog because it&#8217;s not really about web design, but to justify that, I&#8217;ve marked it all up in the (I believe not yet finalised) hrecipe microformat.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope my mum won&#8217;t be too upset that I&#8217;ve posted this up here.  It&#8217;s a family recipe that has been perfected over millennia. Possibly.</p>

<div class="hrecipe">
    
    <p>Here&#8217;s how to make <span class="fn">the ultimate chocolate cake</span>.  Unlike most chocolate cake, this isn&#8217;t at all dry or rich.  It&#8217;s nice and sweet with a soft, gooey texture.</p>

    <p>You&#8217;ll need to make the cake icing after you&#8217;ve taken the cake out and it has cooled a bit.  It sets reasonably quickly, but make sure it&#8217;s not too runny before pouring over the cake.</p>
