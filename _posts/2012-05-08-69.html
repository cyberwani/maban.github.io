<p><a href="http://paulrobertlloyd.com/">Paul Lloyd</a> has an <a href="http://paulrobertlloyd.com/about/styleguide/">excellent style guide</a> which I'm frequently sending to people who are looking at creating their own. Now he's just released his first version of <a href="https://github.com/paulrobertlloyd/barebones">Barebones</a> on Github.</p>

<p>It contains a style guide like the one on his site which lists all the different elements that could be used on a site (paragraphs, headings, links&hellip;) and explains when and where you could use them.</p>

<p>There's also a section which is forked from Jeremy's <a href="https://github.com/adactio/Pattern-Primer">Pattern Primer</a>. This lets you show modules, such as error messages, pagination and comment forms, alongside their snippets of code.</p>

<p>You should try out Barebones in your next project. I've added this and a few other links to my <a href="http://gim.ie/fZyK">front-end style guide stash</a> if you're looking for more inspiration.</p>
